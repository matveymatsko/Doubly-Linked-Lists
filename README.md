# Doubly-Linked-Lists
I created a makeshift doubly linked list class that includes basic functions for linked lists. I also implemented a few node iterator classes that work with functions in the C++ algorithm library. 


If you would like to add a new function for the doubly linked lists class, make sure to declare it in the LinkedLists.h file and have the definition implemented in LinkedLists.cpp file.
